## Boyer Web Studios
This project contains the full starter theme for [Boyer Web Studios](https://www.boyerwebstudios.com), built on Craft 3 and Webpack 4. 

## About 
In addition to setting up a new Craft 3 CMS project, this project sets up:
 
* [Craft 3 Multi-Environment](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft3-multi-environment) as described in the [Multi-Environment Config for Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/multi-environment-config-for-craft-cms) article
* [Craft-Scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts) as described in the [Database & Asset Syncing Between Environments in Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/database-asset-syncing-between-environments-in-craft-cms), [Mitigating Disaster via Website Backups](https://nystudio107.com/blog/mitigating-disaster-via-website-backups) & [Hardening Craft CMS Permissions](https://nystudio107.com/blog/hardening-craft-cms-permissions) articles

It also installs a few base plugins described in the [Setting up a New Craft 3 CMS Project](https://nystudio107.com/blog/enhancing-a-craft-cms-3-website-with-a-custom-module) article.

## Installation

First, clone the repository onto your local machine and install the project dependencies by running `composer install`. If installing on a production environment, run `yarn install --production`. Otherwise, run `yarn`. 

Then `cd` to your new project directory, and run Craft's `setup` console command to create your `.env` environments and optionally install:

    cd PATH
    ./craft setup

Next, run the `nys-setup` command to configure Craft-Scripts & Craft 3 Multi-Environment based on your newly created `.env` settings:

    ./nys-setup
    
Finally, run `./craft install` to run the craft installation scripts. 

That's it, enjoy!

If you ever delete the `vendor` folder or such, just re-run:

    ./nys-setup

...and it will re-create the symlink to your `.env.sh`; don't worry, it won't stomp on any changes you've made.

## Build Process

To build for production, make sure `yarn` and `composer` dependencies are installed, then run `yarn build`. To build for a local environment and watch for changes, run `yarn watch`. 

## About Craft CMS

Craft is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. It is optimized for bespoke web and application development, offering developers a clean slate to build out exactly what they want, rather than wrestling with a theme.
